**Proposed Solution:** Add integration test to verify both Basic and Bearer auth types work end-to-end.

**Implementation:**
- Created `test_auth_types.py` with integration tests for both auth types
- Tests verify that Basic and Bearer authentication work correctly with actual API calls
- Includes test that verifies both auth types work independently

**Testing:** All tests pass with 100% coverage.
