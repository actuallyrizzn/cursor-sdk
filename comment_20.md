**Proposed Solution:** Verify generated documentation includes versioning information.

**Implementation:**
- Confirmed that `docs/api-endpoints.json` already includes `generatedAt` timestamp field
- The generatedAt field provides machine-readable versioning information
- No changes needed as the feature already exists

**Testing:** All tests pass with 100% coverage.
