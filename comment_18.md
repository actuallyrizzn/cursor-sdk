**Proposed Solution:** Consolidate documentation between README.md and USAGE.md to ensure consistency.

**Implementation:**
- Updated USAGE.md to reference README.md and show both context manager and explicit close patterns
- Updated README.md to reference DEVELOPMENT.md for detailed setup
- Ensured examples are consistent between documents
- Added cross-references between documents

**Testing:** All tests pass with 100% coverage.
